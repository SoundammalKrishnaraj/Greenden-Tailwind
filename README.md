Plant Selling Website

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project, GreenDen, a website built to sell plants online. This project was developed using Tailwind CSS and HTML to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface for plant enthusiasts.

Tech Stack:
Tailwind CSS: For a modern, customizable design that adapts well to various screen sizes.
HTML: For semantic and structured markup to ensure clean code.

Features:
Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile users.
Simple and intuitive navigation to help users easily browse and purchase plants.
Lightweight and fast-loading pages, optimized for an improved user experience.
Clean, minimalistic UI that highlights the beauty of the plants.

Why this Project?
The idea behind GreenDen was to create an e-commerce website that feels natural and inviting, just like the plants it features. The use of Tailwind CSS allowed me to rapidly build a flexible and modern layout while maintaining great visual consistency across the site.
